    <blockquote><p>We love this place and have been coming back every year as a family for the last 4 years. We have stayed in both the Granary and the Byre. The accommodation is extremely spacious and well kitted out with a lovely garden, great for summer BBQs. Excellent beaches nearby. Would highly recommend. &#8211; <strong>Helen</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>I just wanted to say thank you so much for letting us stay in your gorgeous cottage! It offered a lovely home from home experience and we really enjoyed our stay. We have already passed over your details to 2 friends as they loved our pictures so much<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">. &#8211; </span><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Gemma</strong></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>We have just returned from  a week at The Granary and would just like to say a massive thank you !!!! What an absolute gem of a place. We decided to book this place last minute to take my mother away one last time as she has been given months to live due to terminal cancer. I can safely say that it made her so happy and everything you could have wanted was there and more. The biggest thank you is to the pleasure it gave her to be in on of her favourite places for one last time.</p>
<p>Myself and my partner have highly recommended this place to many of our colleagues within the healthcare industry and I can assure you we will be receiving a booking from us again.<span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> </span></p>
<p>Many Thanks !!!! worth 10 stars in our eyes<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">. &#8211; </span><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Warren</strong></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Just to let you know how much we have enjoyed our stay at the Granary. Starting from our comfortable and well equipped base, we have explored the coast of South and West Pembrokeshire to our hearts&#8217; content. There is so much to see and people we meet are always suggesting another place to visit. We love the beautiful sandy beaches, the &#8220;local&#8221; beach at Freshwater West has proved a particular favourite with the dogs and our first port of call in the mornings. Watching the surfers in action makes me wish I were 20 (well, ok, 30) years younger. At the end of the day it is a particular pleasure to sit out in the garden with supper and a nice glass of wine.</p>
<p>As a bit of a &#8220;foodie&#8221;, I really appreciated your tip off about Pembrokeshire Produce Direct. Those lovely, helpful people arranged for the Granary to be well stocked when we arrived. Everything we needed in the way of fresh food, a few treats and even biscuits for the dogs was in place and we had a good top up for the second week. When I get home I shall pine for the quality of the meat, the freshness of the produce and as for the crab and the lobster..</p>
<p>Might just have to do it all again. &#8211; <strong>Mich</strong></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; color: #2b601b} -->We have stayed in The Byre once and the Granary twice. They are both beautiful, well maintained cottages that are fitted out with everything you could possibly need to make them a  home from home. We love the location of these cottages and the nearby beach is wonderful (as are the many beaches in the vicinity). It is so refreshing to find such wonderful accommodation that allows you to bring your dogs. That said any non dog lovers who may be put off at the idea of staying in a dog friendly cottage should think again, neither The Byre or The Granary appear in any way &#8216;dog weathered&#8217; as so many dog friendly properties often do.</p>
<p>On our recent visit to The Granary (April 2011) we were accompanied by our, at the time, 7 month old son and my parents. Having sung the praises of these cottages to my parents you worry that they will not be disappointed &#8211; we need not have worried. As for our son, he had a high chair and cot all set up for him on our arrival so with somewhere to eat and somewhere to sleep his needs were well catered for too.</p>
<p>Lovely cottages, highly recommended. &#8211; <strong>Katie</strong></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>We have stayed at The Byre on several occasions, we just feel in love with the place from the romantic main bedroom to the large comfortable sofa with the wood burning stove on. The kitchen is very well equipped and the garden furniture chairs that rock are also a great feature. Apart from the stunning beaches and coastal walks we always visit Narberth, great shops including the most wonderful cheese shop. Well worth a visit. Have already booked for next year. &#8211; <strong>Trudy</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>We have had a wonderful (very) long weekend staying at the Granary with our 2 labradors. The accommodation was excellent and easy to use. My partner loved the underfloor heating! The countryside around the cottage is breathtaking, all facilities are close by, and many pubs to choose from. Freshwater West beach is only a few minutes away and one of several excellent coastal destinations within reach. Booking was simple, reasonably priced, can&#8217;t fault it in any way. Will be back next year for sure! &#8211; <strong>Bruno</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>We have enjoyed our stays at both the Byre and the Granary, Pen-y-holt is very conveniently situated for walking along the coastal paths and for wildlife watching, especially the seabirds in spring but also spotting seals and even a basking shark.  It is lovely to come back to a very comfortable and well appointed cottage at the end of a day out. We love the fresh way you have fitted them out whilst keeping the character of the buildings. Our only quibble is that you will attract too many people and we will never get to stay anymore! &#8211; <strong>Tricia</strong></p></blockquote>
